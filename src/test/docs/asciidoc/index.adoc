This is a sample document for testing Asciidoctor themes.
This is copying a selection of Asciidoctor syntax showcased in
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the official quick reference].

== Text

=== Paragraphs

Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.
Newlines within a paragraph are not displayed.

 A paragraph offset by at least one space becomes a literal paragraph.
 All lines in a literal paragraph must be adjacent.

NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information.
Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

WARNING: Watch out for...

CAUTION: Ensure that...

=== Formatted text

*bold phrase* & **char**acter**s**

_italic phrase_ & __char__acter__s__
